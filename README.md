Three useful maths utility functions are added.

The square_root.cpp utility computes the square root of
a nonnegative function; the gcd.cpp utility finds the 
greatest common divisior between two integers;
the power.pp utility raises a non-zero integer
to a power of another integer.

All three are written in C++ and form part of a
numerical programming series.
